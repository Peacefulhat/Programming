Variable modifiers: 

Auto means Automaic:
 Variable declared inside a scope by default are automatic variable . gets destroyed after completion of scope.
 global varibale if we dont initialize with value it will be initialize with 0.

 syntax: auto type Name;

 Extern modifier:

 int var; means declration and defination.
 extern int var; means declartion only.
-extern is short name for exteral .
-used when a particular file needs to access a variable from another file.
multiple declartion are allow and multiple defination are not allow;
extern tell that go out of the scope and check the entiy out side of scope first it will check the current file then other files.
when an extern variable is initialized, then memory for this variable is allocated and it will be considered defined.

Register:
syntax: register some_data_type variable_name;
-its like we are telling the compiler that this variable is going to be used frequently.
-Register keyword hits the compiler to store a variable in register memory.
-This done because access time reduces greatly for most frequently referred variables.
-This is the choice of compiler whether it puts the given variable in register or not.
-usually compiler themselves do the necessary optimizations.

Static:
