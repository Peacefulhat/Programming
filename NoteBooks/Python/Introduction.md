### What is python programming language ?
	 Python is a high-level programming language known for its
	 simpicity and readability.
	 It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
	 Python is widely used for various purposes including web
	 development , data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific
	 computing, automation, and more.

#### What makes python different from other languages ?
	Python stands out from other programming languages in several
	ways:
	
	1) Readability: Python's syntax is designed to be clean and 
					readable , with a focus on simplicity and 
					clarity. This makes it easier for a developer
					to write and maintain code.

	2) Versatility: Python is versatile language that can be used
					for wide range of application, from web 
					development and data analysis to artificial
					intelligence and scientific computing. Its 
					extensive standard library and rich ecosystem
					of third-party packages make suitable for 
					almost any task.

	3) Interpreted language: Python is an interpreted language which
	                        means that code is executed line by 
	                        line by an interpreter at runtime.
	                         This makes development and debugging
	                          easier, as developers can 
	                        quickly test and itrate on their code
	                         without the nedd from compliation.

	 4) Dynamic Typing: Pythonis dynamically typed, meaning that
	                variables do not have predefined types and can
	                 change type during execution. This provides 
	                 flexibility and allows for rapid development 
	                 but can also lead to potential runtime errors
	                  if not carefully managed.

      5) Strong Community: Python has large and active community of
					      developers who contribute to its
					       development, create libraries and 
					       frameworks, and rpovide support and 
					       resources for fello programmers. This 
					       strong community support is 
					       one of the key resons fro pytho's 
					       popularity and success.

	6) Cross-platform: Python is cross-platform, meaning that it can
	                 run on various operating systems, including 
	                  Windows, macOS, and Linux , without requiring 
	                  any modifications to the code. This makes it
	                   easier to write code that can be deployed on
	                    multiple platforms.

	7) Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented 
	                programming(OOP) principles, allowing 
	                developers to create reusable and modular code
	                 suing classes and objects. This makes it 
	                 easier to manage complex code bases and 
	                 promote code reusability.

	8) Large Standard Library: Python comes with comprehensive 
	                          standard library that provides 
	                          supprot for common tasks such as file
	                           I/O, networking and data processing.
	                          This reduces the need for 
	                           developers to write code from 
	                           scratch and helps accelerate 
	                          development.		
	

#### Disadvantages of python
1. **Performance:** Compared to lower-level languages like C or C++, Python can be slower in terms of execution speed and memory consumption. While this might not be a significant issue for many applications, it can be a concern for performance-critical tasks.
    
2. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):** Python's Global Interpreter Lock can hinder performance in multi-threaded applications by allowing only one thread to execute Python byte code at a time. This limitation can impact the scalability of certain types of applications.
    
3. **Mobile Development:** While Python can be used for mobile development using frameworks like Kivy or Bee Ware, it is not as commonly used as languages like Java or Swift for native mobile app development.
    
4. **Design Restrictions:** Python's dynamic typing and flexibility can sometimes lead to design restrictions and difficulties in maintaining large code bases. Without strict typing, it can be challenging to catch certain types of errors during development.
    
5. **Packaging and Distribution**:
Packaging and distributing Python applications can be more complex compared to some other languages. Managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility across different environments can sometimes be challenging.
