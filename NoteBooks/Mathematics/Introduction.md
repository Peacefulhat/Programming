### What is Mathematics ?
*Mathematics is study of numbers , shapes and patterns. the word comes from the greek word {methema} meaning "knowledge , study , learning".* 
#### Mathematics includes the study of 
#### 1) Numbers
- How things can be counted.
#### 2) Structures
- How things are organised, this sub field is known as "Algebra".
#### 3)Geometry
- Where things and there arrangements are studied.
#### 4) Change
- How things becomes different, this sub field is usually called "Analysis".
*These are some of the thing that we study under mathematics but mathematics is so broad subject.*

### Foundation of mathematics 
#### What is a Digit ?
- A digit is a single symbol use to make a number every number is not a digit but number consists of digits .
#### What is a Number ?
- A number is  an abstract way to represent a quantity. the symbol we use to represent number are **0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9** .
   Example: 123 

#### What is a Number System ?
- The technique to represent and work with numbers is called a number system . A number of base or radix "r" is a system that uses distinct symbols of r digits number are represent by string  of digit symbols .
		Example: 140 .
#### Types of Number System ?

#### 1) Positional number system (Place value system)
- The value of symbol depends on its position in the representation of number.
	Example: the 2 in 20 represents two tens.
			the 2 in 200 represents two hundreds.
	
*"A pure positional value system requires a base and symbols including a symbol for zero and one for each counting less than the base " .*

- Positional values are based on base an the location of digit to determine the positional value , you take the base that corresponds to digit location.
*The given example is for base 10 number system.*
$$
	Example: 10^\infty ...10^3,10^2,10^1,10^0 .
$$
*"The power of base increases more towards left side of number"*
$$
	 Example: 2022 =  2\times10^3 + 2\times10^1 + 2\times10^0
$$
*and power of base must be raised from 0 to n.*
*==any digits base/digit power as zero is known as ones in decimal==* 
$$
Example: 2023 =2\times1000 + 0\times100 + 2\times10 + 3\times1
$$
*here first 2 from left side place value is 1000.*
*same goes for others, with there respected place values*

* In, 2023 the left most 2 is known as ==most significant digit(MSD)==. meaning in the given number , 2 has the highest significance ,and the 3 is know as ==least significant digit(LSD)==. meaning in the given number the 3 has least significance.*
#### Face value
- Face value of number can be represented as the value of the digit in the number itself.
	Example : the face value of digit 3 in number 39 is 3 itself.
#### Place value
- Place value represents the position of digit in a number.
	Example: the place value of 3 in 394 is hundreds place .
- Place value deals with the position of the digit and the face value represents the actual value of digit.

#### 2) Non-Positional System
- The number system in which the symbol or digits used in a number does not depends on any local value or position is called non-positional system.
	Example: Roman Number System.
		    Counting with only one symbol etc.
