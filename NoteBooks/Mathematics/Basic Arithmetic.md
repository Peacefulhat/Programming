*Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers especially concerning the properties of traditional operations on them.*
*Addition, subtraction , multiplication ,division exponents and extraction of roots* 

### Traditional operations / elementary mathematics operations

#### 1) Addition
- The combination of two numbers to become one number (sum).or like combining two like quantities kind of.
	  symbol: + 
	  
		$$
			Example:\begin{aligned}2+3 = 5\\
			 13 + 7 = 20 \end{aligned}
		
		$$
#### 2) Subtraction 
- The opposite operation to addition in this we take one quantity from another to find what is reaming. 
- It is also known as difference
	  Symbol: -
	
	$$
		Example: \begin{aligned}3-2 =1\\
		30-15 =15 \end{aligned}
		
	$$
##### Properties of Addition and Subtraction
-  Addition is commutative, meaning the order of numbers does not 
	matter.
	
$$
Example:\begin{aligned}3+2 = 5\\
2+3=5 \end{aligned}

$$

- Sum remains the same in both the cases.

- Subtraction is not commutative.

$$Example:\begin{aligned} 3-2 =1\\
2-3 \neq 1
\end{aligned}
$$
	
-  Addition is associative , meaning if we perform two or more successive addition the order in which addition is carried out does not matter.

$$ Example: \begin{aligned} (2+3)+3=8\\
2+(3+3)=8
\end{aligned}
$$
	
- Subtraction is not associative 

$$Example: \begin{aligned} (3-2)-1 =0 \\
3-(2-1)=2 \end{aligned} $$

#### Multiplication 
- Is a process of Calculating the products of two or more numbers.
	Symbol:"X" or "."

$$Example:\begin{aligned}2\times1 = 2\\ 2 \times 2 =4 \end{aligned}$$

=="We can say that multiplication is successive addition of number for definite number of times."==
	$$
	Exmaple:\begin{align} 2\times4 = 8 =2+2+2+2 \\4\times2 = 8=4+4 \end {align}
    $$

	![[multiplication.png]]
	
> [!NOTE]
>   - Numbers that give a product when multiplied together are called factors of product.
 >- Factors divide a number completely without leaving any remainder.

$$ Example: \frac{8}{2} =4,\frac{8}{2}=4 , \frac{8}{8}=1,8/1=8$$

- Here 1,2,4,8 are factors of number 8


#### Division
- Division is splitting into equal parts . division is a method of splitting ,distribution of a group into equal parts.

$$Symbols: \div ,/$$

![[division1.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> Division is actually repeated subtraction.

##### Key terms
-  Dividend: Is a value that is divided by another value.
-  Divisor:  Is a value that divides another value either  completely or with remainder.
-  Quotient: A quotient is the result of division problem.
-  Remainder: Is a portion of dividend that can not be fairly divided by the divisor and if divisor completely divides than remainder becomes zero.

$$ \begin{align}Example:\frac{15}{5}=3+0.....(1)\\
Example:\frac{15}{2}=7+1.......(2) \end{align}
$$

- In, above example number one,'3' is the "quotient" and '0' is the "remainder".
- In, above example  number two, '7' is the "quotient" and '1' is the "remainder".

==Multiplication is both associative and commutative in nature.== 
==Division is not commutative and associative .==

#### Basic arithmetic operations using place value technique
- Addition:

$$\begin{align}Example:875+375\\=800+70+5+300+70+5\\=1250\end{align}$$

 - Subtraction: 

$$\begin{align}Example:736-145\\=700+30+6-(100+4+5)\\=591\end{align}$$

- Multiplication:

$$\begin{align}Example:145\times7\\
=(140+5)\times7 
=1015 \end{align}
$$

- Division:

$$\begin{align}Example:1015\div7
(1001+14)\div7\\
=143+2=145\end{align}
$$

> [!NOTE] 
> If divisor is greater than dividend the value will lie in between o to 1 ,meaning we have to use fraction or decimal to express it.
> if a divisor is not able to divide dividend properly it will leave a remainder it can't be further solved or represent in decimal or fraction. 

#### Factors
- "Divides a number completely with out leaving any remainder" if you divide a number A by another number B ,if B | A with out leaving a remainder, we say that B is a factor of A and that A is multiple of B   ( A=BC C is some other factor or constant). "|" this vertical bar simply means " divides".

	$$Example:\frac{8}{2}=4,\frac{8}{4}=2$$
==Both 2 and 4 are factors of 8==

- It is often useful to find all the factors of a number.
	Example: factor of 8 are 1,2,4,8.
	
> [!NOTE]
>- "Factor" always appears in pairs"
>- the square number are the only special case where only one element will be left out of its other pair cause it will be pair of its own.

#### How the standard division works
- Example: 635/5

![[howDivisionWorks.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> This how division works under the hood but we don't write every thing

- Using place value approach
- 635=600+30+5
- we know addition is associative and commutative in nature. we can write 635 = (6x10^2+3x10^1x5x10^0)/5 

$$ \frac{6\times10^2}{5}+\frac{3\times10^1}{5}+\frac{5\times10^0}{5}$$

- 6x20+3x2+1 = 127
- This place value approach used fundamentally to solve division
	multiplication addition and subtraction.
==Every number is divisible by 1==
##### Some Divisibility Rules
- There are few rules that make it easier for us to know weather a number divides another number.

-  Divisibility of 2, 5 and 10: 
       To determine if a number is divisible by 2 we simply have 
		to check if its even or any number that ends with 0,2,4,6,
		8 is divisible by 2.

- To see if a number is divisible by 5 we similarly just have to check the last digit is "0" or "5".
- The easiest is the divisibility rule for 10: we just need to check if the last digit is a "0".

- Divisibility of 4 and 8:
	- Unfortunately 4 doesn't divide 10, so we can't see the last
		digit but 4 does divides 100 so we have to slightly modify
		the rule now we write abcd = abx100+cd, we know 4 will 
		always divide 100 so we need to check the last two digit,if 
		its divisible by 4 . then its the number is divisible by 4.

    - The divisibility rule for 8 get even more difficult because
		100 is not divisible by 8 , but 8 does divided 1000 .
		so we just need to check if the last three digits are
		divisible by 8 or not if its divisible by 8 then number is 
		divisible by 8.
		
- Divisibility of 3 and 9:
	- Are kind of different, because 3 and 9 doesn't divide 100 
		or 1000 ,10 or any larger power of 10 ,so old tricks are 
		not going to work .
		Instead we need to use the somtheing called "digit sum" of a
		number, which is simply the sum of all its individual
		digits. Eg: 162 = 1+6+2 = 9 ,if sum is divisible by 3 then
		number is divisible by 3 and if it divisible by 9 then 
		number is divisible by 9.

- Divisibility of 6
	- To check a number is divisible by 6 we just have to check that it is divisible by 2 and 3 .

#### How addition works with carry
![[howAdditionWork.png]]


> [!NOTE] 
> - If the of one's place digit of two number become greater or equal to 10 then we add it can't stay in ones place because once place can hold only 0 to 9 numbers and we have to take the carry and move it into the higher place,which in this case is ten's.
> - If the ten's place value get greater or equal to 100 then we have to shift the higher place side which in this case is hundred's
> - and this can go on for ever.
> - Deep down the basic idea is place value addition.

#### How subtraction work with borrowing
- The idea is kind of similar like addition, but in case of subtraction,instead of carrying from lower place value to higher place value, we borrow multiple of 10 form higher place value to lower place value.!
	 

![[howSubtractionWorks.png]]

- we can clearly see in example that when subtracting a number if the value at any position(place) is smaller than the subtracting number then we have to brow from higher place value in multiple of 10 and add them to lower place value which need it then subtract the values. It will give the true result.
#### How multiplication works
- Multiplication works using distributive law.The trick used in multiplication is that we have to split numbers in multiple of 10's sum .

- ==(a+b)xc=(ac+bc)=ax(c1+c2)+bx(c1+c2), here c1+c2 = c==
 ![[howMultiplicationWorks.png]]
- This is how multiplication works

#### what are prime numbers ?
- The numbers that can't be broken up into products of smaller number are called prime numbers and they have only one pair of factors.
	
> [!NOTE] 
> - 1 it self is not a prime number, so the few prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13...
> - Any number which is not prime can be written as product of prime number,we keep dividing it into more parts until all factors are prime.




![[primeNumbers.png]]

- 2,3,7 are prime numbers and can't be further divided further. The product . 2x2x3x7 is called the "Prime factorization"of 84.

		

> [!NOTE]
>- "The prime factorization is the process of finding / factoring a number 
>    in terms of prime numbers ."
>- Every integer has a prime factorization and no two integer have same prime factorization and this is known as =="Fundamental Theorem Of Arithmetic's"==

#### Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Is a method to find the smallest common multiple between two or more numbers to find the LCM of any two numbers it is important to realize that if A|B, then B needs to have all the prime factors of A (and some some that does not comes in B).
	
			$$\begin{align}Example:12|60\\2\times2\times3|2\times2\times3\times5\end{align}$$
> [!KeyNote] 
>- This is easy to verify: if a prime factor divides A, and A | B then that prime factor must also divides B

- LCM(a,b) = Product of highest power of all common factors

		$$LCM(6,72,120):\begin{align}6=2\times3 \\ 72=2^3\times3\times5 \\
		120=2^3\times3\times5 \end{align}
		$$
	$$LCM(6,72,120)=2^3\times3^2\times5=360$$
	2) Find the LCM of two numbers
		- find prime factorization of each number.
		- combine all prime factors but only duplicate once.

#### Greatest Common Divisor(GCD)
- Once again , GCF means we have of find greatest common factors of given number, to find GCF of a number first we have to find prime factors of numbers using prime factorization. and secondly we have multiply all the numbers which are prime factors which are in both numbers. 

- 1st Method:
![[gcd1.png]]

- 2nd Method:
![[gcd2.png]]


> [!NOTE]
> - If a number is divisible by another number then its is divisible by each of the factor of that number.
> - If a number a is divisible by two co-prime then it is divisible by their product also.

Example: 24 is by 3 and 4
	3=1,3 and 4=1,2,4 -> co-prime numbers.
		then 3|24 , 4|24 then
			4 x 3 = 12 ; 12|24.


> [!NOTE]
>- If a number divides two given number then their **sum** is also divisible by that number.

Example:
	4|16 and 4|20;
	then 16+20 =36 , 4|36

> [!NOTE]
>- If two given number are divisible by a number , then their **difference** is also divisible by that number.


#### Approximation and Estimation {by rounding off}
###### Rule for rounding to nearest 10's {check one place and then round}
- 1,2,3,4 are nearer to 0 then to ten, so round these numbers as 0.
- 6,7,8,9 are close to 10 then 0, so round them off as 10.
- 5 is equidistant from both 0 and 10 but in general it rounded to 10.
	Example:
		28->30 , 41->40, 153->150, 32->20, 2936-> 2940, 99->100.
###### Rule for rounding to nearest 100's
- 1 to 49 are near to ('0') so round them as zero.
- 51 to 99 are near to 100 so round them as 100
- 50 is rounded to 100.
	Example:
		841->800, 49730->49700, 9537->9500
###### Rule for rounding to nearest 1000's
- 1 to 499 are near to '0' round them as zero
- 501 to 999 are nearer to 1000, round them as 1000.
- 500 is also rounded as 1000
	Example:
	41730->42000, 168->200, 49730->50,000
	2546->3000, 9870->10000

#### Order of precedence
- In mathematics, the order of operation is collection of rules ,conventions about which procedure to perform first in order to evaluate a given mathematical expression.
- The acronym Bod-mas, is used to solve a mathematical expression Bod-mas means:
	
	![[BodMas.png]]
- Bod-mas gives us order in which the operations are going to be preformed on a mathematical expression.

- **Brackets** : in mathematics, are used for various tasks but in terms of how the elementary arithmetic operations are performed it enforces the expression inside brackets to be evaluated first.

- Example:(2+3) x 4 =20 forces addition to precede multiplication and 
	(3+5)^2 = 64 forces addition to precede exponentiation  if multiple brackets are required in mathematical exp different kinds of brackets can be used to avoid confusion.
	Example:
	(2+(3 x 6)) - 5 = 15
	
- **Exponentiation** : is a mathematical operation, written as **b^n**, involving two numbers , the base **"b"** and the exponent or power **"n"**.  when **n** is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base that is **b^n** is product of multiplying **"n"** base **"b"**.
- and rest of their bod-mas letters just represent basic arithmetic operations.
#### Fractions
- The word fraction is divided from the Latin word "fractus","broken"
- A fraction represents a part of a whole or, more generally , any number of equal parts, the parts of whole must be divided equally.
- Fraction are parts of whole, whole may be be a single object or group of objects.
- fractions are represented in from of $$\frac{a}{b}$$ called as **a** by **b**.

![[fraction.png]]

- Numerator: Its the upper part of fraction that represents number of parts you have.
- Denominator: Its lower part of fraction that represents total numbers of parts that makes the whole.
- Example:
	The circle is divided into four equal parts, the individual parts can be represented in form of fractions.
- In form of fraction individual parts =1/4 {part you have/total no of parts }.
- shaded parts =2/4{parts you have / total number of parts}.
- fraction are number of parts you have by total number of parts
- number of parts you have / total number of parts.
- ![[fraction2.png]]

#### Fraction on the number line
- Fraction are number that lies between whole numbers {0,1,2,3,4,5....}
and also in between negative numbers.
- Example:
	- 1/2 is greater than 0 and less 1 we show on number line.
	
	![[fraction3.png]]

#### Type of fraction
- Proper fraction: are fractions where the numerator is less than denominator. Example: 8/13, 3/4, 10/11.

- Improper fraction: are those fractions where numerator is greater than denominator. Example: 9/8, 17/5, 11/2, 13/4.

- Mixed fraction: Is a combination a non-zero integer and a proper fraction. These are also called mixed number or mixed numerals.
  Example: 2.1/4.

- Like fraction : If a the denominator of two or more fractions are different then they are called like fraction. Example: 1/6, 2/6, 3/6.

- Unlike fractions: If the denominator of two or more fractions are different then they are called unlike fractions. Example: 1/2, 1/3, 2/5 .
   if the fractions are unlike while adding or subtracting the fraction we convert them two like fractions.

- Equivalent fractions: two or more fractions are equivalent to each other if after simplified or reduced either of two or more fractions is equal to other one . Example: 2/4, 3/6, 4/8 are equal 1/2 so these are equivalent fractions.

- Unit fractions: are fractions where numerator is 1 and denominator is a +ve integer. Example: 1/3, 1/3, 1/6, 1/7.

- Common ,Simple, Vulgar fraction: a fraction where both top and bottom numbers are integer, they can be proper or improper fractions. Example: -1/3, -2/3, 3/2, 8/7

- Dyadic fraction: Is a common fraction in which the denominator is power of '2'. Example: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8

#### Multiplicative inverse 
- In mathematics the number 1/x which multiplied by x given the product 1, also know as a "reciprocal". The multiplicative inverse of fraction a/b is b/a.
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">any integer can be written as a fraction with the number 1 as denominator</span> . therefore 17 can be written 17/1, where 1 is sometimes refereed to as the "invisible" denominator therefore, every fraction or integer except for zero has a reciprocal. Example: 1/17 of 17.
#### Additive inverse
- An **additive inverse** of a number is defined as the value, which on adding with the original number results in zero value
- Example: a+(-a)=0.

#### Multiplicative identity
- An **multiplicative** identity of a number is defined as the value, which by multiplying with the original number leaves it unchanged.
- Example: a x ( b)= a , here b is the multiplicative identity of a.

#### Additive identity
- An **Additive identity** of a number is defined as the value, which on adding to original number leaves it unchanged.
- Example: a +b =a , here b is the additive identity of a
