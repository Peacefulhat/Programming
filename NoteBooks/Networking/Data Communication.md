Data communication are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link(transmission medium) such as cable.

#### Data flow

##### Simplex:
- Communication is always unidirectional.
- one device can transmit and the other device will receive.
- Example: keyboard , monitor etc.

##### Half Duplex:
- communication is in both direction but not at the same time.
- if one device is sending, the other can only receive and vice versa.
- Example: walki-talkie.
##### Full Duplex:
- Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
- Device can send and receive at the same time.
- Example: Telephone line.


##### Protocols
- protocol=Rule.
- All communication schemes will have the following things in common:
	- source or sender.
	- destination or receiver
	- channel or media.
- Rules or protocols governs all the methods of communications.
- it is set of rules that governs data communication.
 - Protocol determines:
	 - What is communicated?
	 - How it is communicated?
	 - When it is communicated?


> [!NOTE] If there are no protocols
> imbalance of communication.
> or communication becomes useless.like one device is sending data that other device is not capable of handling it or its not able to under stand what kind of data is being sent.

#### Protocols - Human Communication
- Protocols are necessary for human communication and include:
- An Identified sender and receiver
- common language and grammar
- speed and timing of delivery
- confirmation or acknowledgement requirement.

#### Protocols - Network communication
#### or Element of a Protocol
- Protocol used in networks communications also define:
	- message encoding
	- Message formatting and encapsulation
	- Message timing
	- Message size
	- Message delivery options
